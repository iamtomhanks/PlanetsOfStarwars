This application connects to an API, retrieves information about the planets in the Stars Wars movies, then displays the data using 2 graphs:

## 1. Bar Graph 
  Shows the planetary orbital and rotational periods for each planet. The select box on the x-axis allows the user to select which data to display.
  
## 2. Scatter Plot
  Shows the orbital period in relation to the rotational period for each planet. 
  
The two graphs can be toggled between using the red toggle switch in the top-left corner. 

Please clone, run npm install, then npm start. Enjoy!
